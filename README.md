## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating my own API
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and Databases
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with others and become a better coder
<br>
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started my coding journey in September 2024 after previously having basic knowledge of HTML and CSS from courses I had taken several years ago. 
After getting stuck into JavaScript, I realized how much I enjoyed coding, and I have gone on to enroll in several courses. I am looking forward to improving my skills and building 
my portfolio.
