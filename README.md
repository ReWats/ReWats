## Hi there ğŸ‘‹


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating my own API
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and Databases
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with others and become a better coder
<br>
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started a my coding journey in September 2024 after previously having basic knowledge of HTML and CSS from courses I had taken during several years ago. 
    After getting stuck in to Javascript, I realised how much I enjoyed coding and I have gone on to enrol in several courses. I am looking forward to improving my skills and building 
    my portfolio.
